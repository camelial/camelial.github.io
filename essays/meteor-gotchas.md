Meteor is one of those things where you either really like it or you really hate it. Overall, I like Meteor, and I'm not going to lie. It's the only app development platform I know so far, and where would I be without it? However, there are some things that I strongly dislike about it. It's like eating delicious banana bread embedded with ransid walnuts and that's how I currently feel about Meteor.

The first thing I complained about, along with the majority of my Software Engineering classmates, was the time it took to set up, install, and run meteor.  One of Meteor's coolest features is that it updates your app live and automatically, which makes things very convenient but also comes with a cost. Maybe my computer is just slow, or maybe I am just too impatient, but nobody wants to wait 100 years before they can see their app running live. While doing one of the timed assignments for my class, I found myself finishing an entire section of the assignment before Meteor had finished doing setup operations. It doesn't feel good when you've finished a big part of your app, only to be greeted with the uncertainty of whether or not you completed it successfully, hoping and praying that you didn't mess up horribly somewhere down the line.

Thankfully, this wasn't a permanent problem - I did find a fix for Windows which required some monkeying around with Meteor's internal files. Meteor still isn't the fastest thing, but it is faster than me, which is good enough in my book. Some of the operations that took Meteor years at the beginning, only take a few minutes now.

Other than the fact that it is slow, there is nothing much else that I have against Meteor (other than Mongo DB, which I will probably end up talking about later on a separate rant.) Meteor is a great handy tool that makes life easier when developing apps. Its automatic updating capability is definitely a perk, and whwen debugging, it gives you a pretty clear idea of where your errors are and how to fix them. Yay Meteor. I am out of time.
