I'm sure we've all been that person before, the scrawny, wide-eyed, clueless middle-schooler roaming around on the internet for answers to a [nagging] homework question, stumbling across a random help forum, and posting something like "HELP!!!!! I can't factor [insert difficult quadratic equation here]!!!!???", only to find that - of the billions of people connected to the internet and the hundreds of thousands participating in said forum - NO ONE has bothered to give you a [decent] answer. You sit in front of the screen for several hours picking your nose, refreshing your browser every two seconds, watching your [urgent question] slowly sinking to the bottom of the list, soon to be forgotten. After four hours, you see a new response! You open it, only to realize that it was just another [bored, too much time on their hands] middle-schooler like you, just looking for somewhere to post dry, cringeworthy math puns. "Everyone on the internet is so rude", you say to yourself, as you sink back into your chair and pick your nose a little more. And while you may not be wrong, there's A LITTLE MORE TO THE STORY THAN KLJGSLK;J;We've all been there before.
