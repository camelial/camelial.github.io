# The problem
 * U.H. Manoa has many events for students.
 * ex. Free stuff, free food, etc.
 * Students don't always know about these events and they miss out on FREE STUFF.
 * Emails get buried in our inboxes because there are so many.
 
# The solution
 * We need an app that can easily notify students about when the events are and where they are.
 * It will have a calendar of events, as well as map.
 * Students can log in and create a profile to customize their personal interests.
 * Interactive map that shows where stuff is happening, prioritized by the student's personal interests.
 * The app would send notifications for events.
 * If we get advanced enough, the student would be able to connect with their friends to see who else is going to the events.
 
#  Mockup page ideas
 * Home page with the events list
 * Profile page
 * Login page
 * Calendar
 * Map
 * Event pages
 
# Use case ideas
 * User goes to the home page and there is a list of events for the day
 * The user can log in and see personalized stuff, set up their profile, and see notifications
 * After logging in, the user can add events to their personal calendar and see more details about events
 
# Beyond the basics
 * The user would be able to add friends mark events as "going, interested, etc" like Facebook and see which of their friends are going.
 * Yelp features - add photos and ratings to events.
