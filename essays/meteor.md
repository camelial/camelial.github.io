If I had the opportunity to make an analogy between using Meteor and being hit on the head with “a small body of matter from outer space that enters the earth’s atmosphere, becoming incandescent as a result of friction and appearing as a streak of light”, I’d snatch that opportunity right up.  But unfortunately, that does not accurately describe my experience with Meteor. Instead, I’d picture learning Meteor as ascending, rather than descending, through the layers of the atmosphere. Running on minimal sleep and optimal stress seems to allow the brain to make crazy connections between unrelated things in ways that are totally unheard of, which is probably why I’m describing learning Meteor as a breaking through the atmosphere and into the stratosphere, even though I don’t actually know what that feels like.

Before you assume that sleep deprivation has gotten the best of me, however, consider this. Meteors are objects that were moving freely through space, but happened to get caught up in Earth’s gravitational field and pulled inevitably towards the ground to fall and be smashed up. With this in mind, we’d associate Meteor with things that crash and burn, right?

But that’s not what happens with Meteor – at least, as long as you are using Meteor the right way. As many various complaints there are about Meteor, it’s not there to crash and burn your app. The reason why I say that Meteor is like ascending in the atmosphere is not because it makes me feel like dying; it is because after learning Meteor, I feel like I have broken through a barrier and reached the next level of computer science education.
