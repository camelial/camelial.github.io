title: JavaScript: Not Bad, Just Weird - In a Good Way.

Back in high school, the only programming language I knew was LabVIEW, and I thought it was the best thing... until I started college and learned Java, and Java became my new favorite language. That only lasted until this past summer when I learned C# for my internship and started writing applications with it. Then, C# topped Java and became the new best language.

From observing this pattern, I've assumed that whatever language I have most recently gotten accustomed to automatically becomes my new favorite and stays my favorite, until I learn another language. But did this pattern apply to JavaScript, which I learned about a week ago? It is hard to say.

Admittedly, my first reaction to being exposed to JavaScript was something like, "What!? Why aren't we declaring the types of the variables? How can we be allowed to put both strings and numbers inside of the same array!? What a weird language." Prior to learning JavaScript, I had been so used to the strict data type bindings that Java, C#, and even LabVIEW had, and I was so used to having to declare the type of a variable and keep it consistent, that I often found myself accidentally writing things like "int" and "string" in my JavaScript code. The fact that JavaScript simply seemed to not care at all was very off-putting at first.
