Is it possible to teach a computer to learn?
It most certainly is.

If it is possible to program a car how to drive itself, to program a phone to give you directions from point A to point B in your own hometown, to program a keyboard to predict the next word you type, then it is most certainly possible to teach a computer how to learn. We are already doing it.

If it is possible to teach a computer to learn, imagine what else is possible. Will we be able to create the Terminator in real life? What about a personal wellness coach robot like Baymax, capable of conversing with a patient, making diagnoses and administering treatments? Fifty years from now, will we be programming computers to speak for those who cannot talk, see for those who are blind, and move for those who are paralyzed? Will we be developing a device that can rewire the disintegrating brain of a dementia patient? This might sound crazy to you now. If it does, remind yourself that fifty years ago, there was no such thing as a cell phone.
