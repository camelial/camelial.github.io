Is it possible to teach a computer to learn?
It most certainly is.

If it is possible to program a car how to drive itself, to program a phone to teach you how to get from point A to point B in your own hometown, to program a keyboard to predict the next word you type, then it is most certainly possible to teach a computer how to learn. We are already doing it.
